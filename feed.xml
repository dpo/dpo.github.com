          An interior algorithm for nonlinear optimization that combines line search and trust region steps - 
          Google announced today that my paper An interior algorithm for nonlinear optimization that combines line search and trust region steps is among the top cited papers published in 2006 in optimization. The paper appeared in Mathematical Programming and concerns extensions of the frighteningly effective KNITRO solver, now known as Artely...

          Iterative Solution of Symmetric Quasi-Definite Linear Systems - 
          SIAM just announced the publication of my book Iterative Solution of Symmetric Quasi-Definite Linear Systems in their Spotlights series, written with Mario Arioli. The book is suitable for a graduate course on iterative methods for linear systems with applications to optimization and fluid dynamics. We distribute software that implements the...
